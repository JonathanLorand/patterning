# Welcome !

This is a place for all participants of the Christopher Alexander reading group to upload files -- whether they be notes, images, reference texts, etc. -- for sharing with the group!

How To:
- please only upload files to the folder with your name on it (so we keep track of who shared what)
- everyone can access all folders and files (that's how we share)
- some file formats will be displayed by the GitHub webpage in a readable form directly: such formats include .txt, .md, .pdf, .jpg, .png, ...
- files in the .docx format of Microsoft Word and various other formats cannot be display on this webpage and not everyone might have the software to display such formats on their personal computer, so it is encouraged, whenever possible, to use file formats that are as accessible as possible!


Further/other info: 
- The word "repository" that is used on the GitHub webpage can be thought of as just meaning "folder" or "place"
- Some documents (such as .txt files and .md files) can be created and/or edited directly in the GitHub webpage (there is a little pencil symbol to enter edit mode). In order to save changes, one needs to scroll down and click the green button labeled with "Commit Changes".
