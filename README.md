Welcome !
This is a place for all participants of the Christopher Alexander reading group to upload files -- whether they be notes, images, reference texts, etc. -- for sharing with the group!

How To:
- please only upload files to your own folder (to keep track of who shared what)
- everyone can access all folders and files (that's how we share)
- some file formats will be displayed by the GitHub webpage in a readable form directly: such formats include .txt, .md, .pdf, .jpg, .png, ...
- word files and other proprietary formats cannot be display on this webpage and not everyone might have the software to display such formats on their personal computer, so it is encouraged, whenever possible, to use file formats that are maximally accessible!


Further/other info: 
- the word "repository" that is used on the GitHub webpage can be thought of as just meaning "folder" or "place"
